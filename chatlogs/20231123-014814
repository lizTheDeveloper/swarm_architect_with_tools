It will identify the key components and structures needed to meet the requirements of the requested tool.\n\n2. **Python Script Writer** - The Python Script Writer would be the primary agent responsible for turning the planned structure into actual Python code. Given that the request is to make Python tools, this agent's coding skills are essential in delivering executable and functional scripts or applications.\n\n3. **Agent-Writing-Agent** - Assuming this agent has capabilities in generating or scaffolding new agents, it would be a meta choice. It can possibly create specialized agents to handle aspects of Python development that are not covered by general agents or to refine the Python tools to be more aligned with the text requests.\n\nThese three agents collectively cover the conceptual planning, the actual coding, and the possible extension or creation of specialized agents to meet specific needs or enhance the functionality of the Python tools.\n\nIf a new agent were to be created to complement these three, I would suggest a **Python Tool Tester Agent**, whose role would be to rigorously test the tools created by the Python Script Writer to ensure they meet the text-based requirements and are free of bugs. However, since you've asked for a maximum of three agents and this agent isn't in the current list, I have focused on the planning, writing, and potential agent creation aspects necessary for the task.\n\nIt is important to note that the synergy between these agents and their ability to effectively communicate requirements and solutions to one another will be crucial for the success of the project."), type='text')], created_at=1700732895, file_ids=[], metadata={}, object='thread.message', role='assistant', run_id='run_ndq2Yk9uiN3Pq9KMTIGzJVoH', thread_id='thread_VL7TcGXjmhFBM2RNg8WbC0Cb')
