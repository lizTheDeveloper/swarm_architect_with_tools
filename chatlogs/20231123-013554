Here are my top choices:\n\n1. **Python Software Planner** - The creation of Python tools begins with thorough planning. This agent seems specialized in outlining the necessary components and structure for Python applications, which would be essential in transforming text-based requests into actionable development plans.\n\n2. **Python Script Writer** - After the planning phase, actual coding is required. An agent skilled in writing Python scripts would be indispensable for the hands-on development of the requested tools. \n\n3. **Agent Builder** - This agent\'s expertise in "building" could be interpreted as the ability to construct and compile code or tools, possibly serving as a bridge between planning and deployment, ensuring that the Python tools are properly assembled and functional.\n\nWhile agents such as **Creation Agent** or **Profile Content Creation Agent** might have a more general skill set appropriate for content generation, their domain-specific skills for Python development are less clear than those of the Python Software Planner and Python Script Writer.\n\nIn addition, it may be beneficial to consider creating a new Agent that specifically addresses the management of text-based software requests and oversees the conversion of these requests into structured plans. This agent would effectively interface with the user and the Python Software Planner to refine and translate user demands into technical specifications. However, considering our constraint on the number of agents, the Python Software Planner may already encompass some of these responsibilities.\n\nAll three selected agents together would form a powerful trio, managing planning, development, and construction phases of Python tool creation, ensuring requests are well understood, thoughtfully planned, efficiently coded, and correctly assembled.'), type='text')], created_at=1700732156, file_ids=[], metadata={}, object='thread.message', role='assistant', run_id='run_tjZpcT4uwIECmoaIYnYbNd7D', thread_id='thread_pnc3Te207DpCJyUgtameZx8O')ThreadMessage(id='msg_89GYjsruHCMconfF1mq1eGP5', assistant_id=None, content=[MessageContentText(text=Text(annotations=[], value="Please find suitable agents for this goal and name any that should be created.
