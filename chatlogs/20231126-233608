Effective curriculum management requires thorough planning, which includes scheduling, sequencing content, and integrating different learning activities. This agent would provide an overarching structure necessary for managing the curriculum efficiently.\n\n2. **Profile Review and Feedback Agent**: While this agent could provide value by offering review and feedback capabilities, it may not be essential for the initial curriculum management setup. Since curriculum management is an ongoing process, the review and feedback may be more of a secondary phase that could be handled later or by other means, such as direct user feedback or performance analytics after the curriculum has been implemented.\n\n3. **Lesson-Writing Agent**: This agent is relevant but might not be necessary in the context of curriculum management. The creation of specific educational content can be a separate task, particularly if the curriculum is at a higher level of organization, focusing more on what topics are taught and when rather than the creation of the actual lesson content. Unless the curriculum management includes content creation, which was not specified as part of the initial goal, this agent may not be necessary.\n\nTherefore, out of the three agents, the Planning Agent seems the most critical to recruit for the current goal.
