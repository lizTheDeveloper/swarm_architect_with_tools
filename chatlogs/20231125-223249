They can outline the necessary steps, conceptualize the architecture, and break down the coding tasks to ensure that the Python tool development process is structured and efficient.\n\n2. **Python Script Writer** - Paired with the Python Software Planner, the Python Script Writer is crucial in actually writing the code for the tools. They would take the software plan and turn it into functional Python scripts that meet the requirements outlined in the request.\n\n3. **Agent-Writing-Agent** - This agent seems to be a meta-agent with the capability to create other agents. If the Python tools requested are complex enough to warrant the creation of specialized agents for their operation or development, the Agent-Writing-Agent would be able to generate these with the necessary skills and functions.\n\nThere isn't a need to create a new agent based on the agents available; these three should cover the planning, coding, and potential agent creation aspects of the task at hand. Their skills complement each other, and together they offer a comprehensive approach to creating Python tools from text-based requests. Moreover, limiting the selection to three ensures efficient communication and better coordination among the agents."), type='text')], created_at=1700973170, file_ids=[], metadata={}, object='thread.message', role='assistant', run_id='run_EhEVCmTZH7LZsOE86MWXN0ST', thread_id='thread_wdi1VuJm6QsxYQh9G8hvquDT')
