Below is a detailed plan for each of these tools:\n\n### 1. Curriculum File Tree Reader\n**Tool Name**: `read_file_tree`\n- **Input**: A path to the root directory of the curriculum file tree.\n- **Output**: A structured representation (such as a dictionary or JSON object) of the curriculum file tree, including directories and file paths.\n- **Specification**: This tool will recursively read the directory structure starting from the given root path. It will return a nested structure that represents folders and files within each folder.\n\n### 2. Markdown File Reader\n**Tool Name**: `read_markdown_file`\n- **Input**: A file path to a markdown file within the curriculum.\n- **Output**: A string containing the full text of the markdown file.\n- **Specification**: This tool will open and read the contents of the given markdown file. It will be used to extract data from syllabus files and lesson documents.\n\n### 3. Summary-Based Categorization\n**Tool Name**: `categorize_resource`\n- **Input**: A string containing the summary of a resource.\n- **Output**: A string representing the most suitable directory path within the curriculum file tree where the resource should be placed.\n- **Specification**: This tool will leverage the AI agentâ€™s capabilities to analyze the summary and understand the content and context. Using the file tree data from `read_file_tree`, it can then determine the most fitting location for the resource within the current curriculum structure.\n\n### 4. Curriculum Format Normalizer\n**Tool Name**: `normalize_format`\n- **Input**: A string containing the full text of a markdown-formatted document.\n- **Output**: A string containing the formatted and standardized markdown text.\n- **Specification**: This tool will have predefined templates and rules that outline the standard structure for different document types (e.g., syllabus, lesson plan). It will parse and reformat the input text to adhere to these standards, correcting inconsistencies and restructuring content as needed.\n\nEach of these tools will be designed to work in coordination with the others to achieve the overall goal of curriculum management.

Here is a critique of each tool and its relevance to the end goal:\n\n### 1. Curriculum File Tree Reader (`read_file_tree`)\n- **Relevance**: Essential for understanding the current curriculum structure; a necessary step before resources can be categorized.\n- **Critique**: It should also provide functionality to handle different file formats beyond markdown if necessary.\n\n### 2. Markdown File Reader (`read_markdown_file`)\n- **Relevance**: Crucial for retrieving the content of the curriculum files for further processing and analysis.\n- **Critique**: This tool is relevant as long as the curriculum materials are primarily in markdown format. If additional formats are used, similar tools may be required for those formats.\n\n### 3. Summary-Based Categorization (`categorize_resource`)\n- **Relevance**: Directly addresses the goal of resource placement within the curriculum based on a summary.\n- **Critique**: It is essential to ensure that the language model's capabilities are sufficiently advanced to accurately categorize resources. The tool will also need data from the `read_file_tree` to understand the existing structure for categorization.\n\n### 4. Curriculum Format Normalizer (`normalize_format`)\n- **Relevance**: This directly serves the goal of standardizing formats across the curriculum, ensuring consistency.\n- **Critique**: The tool must be configurable to handle different templates and standards for various types of educational materials.\n\nWith these critiques in mind, all suggested tools appear to be necessary and relevant. However, the Planning Agent should ensure that each tool's design accommodates potential variations in file types and formats and coordinates seamlessly with the other tools. \n\nAdditionally, error handling, security, and privacy should be highlighted in the implementation specifics to guarantee the robustness and integrity of the system.\n\nGiven that the tools align with the goals and have been properly critiqued, the request for these tools' creation should be made. I will now request each tool, starting with the `read_file_tree` function.\n\n```python\nrequest_tool('read_file_tree')\nrequest_tool('read_markdown_file')\nrequest_tool('categorize_resource')\nrequest_tool('normalize_format')\n```\n\nIf there are any additional considerations or modifications required before creation, the Planning Agent should address these.
