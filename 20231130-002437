The client credentials and OAuth2 tokens should never be hard-coded or checked into version control.

Breaking down the tool into three main components (Authentication Tool, Email Composition Tool, and Sending Email Tool) provides a clear separation of concerns, which is good practice for software development and maintenance.\n\nEach component is indeed necessary:\n\n1. **Authentication Tool** – Since the Gmail API requires authenticated requests, this tool is essential. The Gmail API uses OAuth2 for authentication, and handling OAuth2 is non-trivial. It involves web redirects, token generation, and token refreshing. Therefore, having a dedicated tool to encapsulate this complexity is appropriate.\n\n2. **Email Composition Tool** – Constructing MIME messages is a prerequisite for sending emails, and the tool handles the subtleties of this, including attachments and proper encoding. While composing an email is relatively straightforward, handling attachments and encoding can be error-prone, warranting a dedicated function.\n\n3. **Sending Email Tool** – This is obviously necessary, as it is the final step that actually sends the email using the Gmail API. This function must be aware of the intricacies of the API call, making it a necessary component of the overall tool.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that these tools must also include robust error handling to deal with potential issues such as network failures, changes in the API, or invalid input data. This requirement was addressed in the description.\n\nAdditionally, managing sensitive information securely is correctly emphasized by allocating secure management for API credentials and OAuth tokens. Since this is a critical aspect of using an API, the recommendation to use environment variables or secure storage is an important consideration to protect user data and comply with best practices.\n\nTo proceed, we can request the creation of these tools, ensuring that the `request_tool` function is called with each tool\'s name as per the requirement:\n\n```python\nrequest_tool("OAuth2_Client_Setup")\nrequest_tool("Email_Composition_Tool")\nrequest_tool("Sending_Email_Tool")\n```\n\nBefore the Tool Creation Agent begins their work, ensure that the calling sequences, input parameters, and return values of each function are clearly defined and documented. This will aid in the maintainability and usability of the tools. Furthermore, make sure to review the security practices for storing OAuth tokens and client secrets to comply with privacy concerns and regulations.'), type='text')], created_at=1701325525, file_ids=[], metadata={}, object='thread.message', role='assistant', run_id='run_n9uZG76jlTUhmdeW18NmkEor', thread_id='thread_NUWmu66jcN2tQsgBvVckhgMI')
