Curriculum Tree Reader (`read_curriculum_tree`)\nThe purpose of this tool is to create a readable representation of the curriculum structure. It will traverse directories starting from a root path, thereby capturing the hierarchy and organization.\n\n- **Specifications**:\n  - Should handle directory traversal recursively.\n  - Ignore non-markdown files.\n  - Represent each folder as a dictionary with the folder name and list of subfolders and files.\n\n### 2. Markdown Parser (`parse_markdown`)\nThis tool will extract structured data from markdown files, enabling analysis of the document structure and content.\n\n- **Specifications**:\n  - Identify markdown sections and sub-sections.\n  - Organize content under these sections in the structured output.\n  - Handle various markdown syntax elements like headers, lists, code blocks, etc.\n\n### 3. Summary Analyzer and Classifier (`classify_resource`)\nGiven a summary, this tool employs a language model to suggest the most suitable destination folder within the curriculum structure.\n\n- **Specifications**:\n  - Use Natural Language Processing to understand the summary context.\n  - Compare it against the existing curriculum structure.\n  - Suggest the most appropriate folder path based on thematic similarity.\n\n### 4. Format Normalizer (`normalize_format`)\nThis tool ensures that all syllabus and lesson documents follow a standard format. It will restructure a markdown file to conform to a predefined template.\n\n- **Specifications**:\n  - Define a standard template for document structures.\n  - Reorganize and reformat the input markdown content to match the template.\n  - Preserve the original content while applying the new format.\n\n### 5. Persistence Manager (`save_normalized_file`)\nOnce a document is normalized, this tool will handle the saving of the updated file to a designated location.\n\n- **Specifications**:\n  - Ensure proper file writing permissions.\n  - Overwrite the existing file or create a new one as indicated.\n  - Return a confirmation message on successful save or an error message.\n\n## Final Notes\n\nThe output for each tool should be in a format amenable to chaining, allowing for streamlined processing. While developed as separate modular functions, the intent is for these to work in conjunction within a larger script for complete curriculum management.\n\nInputs and outputs should be validated, and meaningful errors should be returned to facilitate debugging during integration. It is critical that the outputs of these tools ultimately return string representations to integrate with ChatGPT seamlessly.\n```\n\nThese tool specifications act as a guide for the language model to produce the desired functions in a Python development environment.

However, there are aspects worth critiquing to refine the plan and ensure practical implementation:\n\n1. **Curriculum Tree Reader** (`read_curriculum_tree`):\n   - This tool is essential for mapping out the curriculum\'s existing structure and is necessary for providing the context for resource placement.\n   - Improvement: Ensure that the JSON-like dictionary is easy to parse and align with Python data structures commonly used for manipulating directories and files.\n\n2. **Markdown Parser** (`parse_markdown`):\n   - Parsing markdown files is critical to understand the content and structure, which is essential for both classification of where resources should go and for normalizing the format.\n   - Improvement: Additionally, provide specifications for handling different types of markdown elements (e.g., tables, images, links) that may need special consideration.\n\n3. **Summary Analyzer and Classifier** (`classify_resource`):\n   - Utilizing a language model to recommend a location for new resources is appropriate for the goal. This tool facilitates the intelligent organization of the curriculum.\n   - Improvement: Make sure the tool takes into account the entire existing curriculum structure and not just the immediate file tree for enhanced context-aware classification.\n\n4. **Format Normalizer** (`normalize_format`):\n   - Ensuring that all documents follow a standard format is essential for consistency, making this tool necessary.\n   - Improvement: There should be case handling for content that doesn\'t fit the new template neatly. The standard templates should also be easily modifiable to accommodate changes in the curriculum\'s structural requirements.\n\n5. **Persistence Manager** (`save_normalized_file`):\n   - This is critical for saving the changes made by the format normalizer. It\'s a necessary component for actual file updates.\n   - Improvement: The plan should mention creating backups before overwriting any files to prevent data loss.\n\nOverall, the proposed tools align with the goal. Each serves a purpose in the workflow of managing and organizing the curriculum. However, each tool should be slightly refined to cover a range of potential edge cases and ensure that the larger system is robust and error-tolerant.\n\nNow, proceeding to request the creation of these tools:\n\n```python\nrequest_tool("read_curriculum_tree")\nrequest_tool("parse_markdown")\nrequest_tool("classify_resource")\nrequest_tool("normalize_format")\nrequest_tool("save_normalized_file")\n```\n\nWith these requests submitted, the Planning Agent can proceed to create detailed specifications and examples for each tool to guide the Tool Creation Agent.'), type='text')], created_at=1701222139, file_ids=[], metadata={}, object='thread.message', role='assistant', run_id='run_PuiyOfWkia0OTPdcYjXksM7b', thread_id='thread_MGGp3WwCPBF8xRuQKhErslli')
